# watering-system
Automatic watering system based on ATmegaxx8 microcontrollers.

Using the code or boards is not currently recommended for long-term use.



TODO:
(items in **bold** are scheduled for the next release. Items which have been dealt with are ~~struck through~~.)
  * **Add EEPROM-stored settings, which can be changed over the serial port**
  * Add sleep code for lower power consumption
  * ~~Add individual watering. The code currently uses one pump for both plants~~
  * Replace linear regulator with switching
  * Add optional float switch for water tank
  * Add optional voltage sensing for batteries (with settings for various chemistries)
