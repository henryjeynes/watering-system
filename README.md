# watering-system
This is an automatic plant watering system for an Arduino. This is a mostly experimental repository, and the code and board files within may not work correctly.

DO NOT use the code and boards available here for watering plants until version 1.0a is released, or until the boards and code are confirmed to work.



TODO:
  -Add EEPROM-stored settings, which can be changed over the serial port
  -Add sleep code for lower power consumption
